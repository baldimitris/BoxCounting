# BoxCounting
The Box Counting method calculates the Fractal Dimension of an image. It is a way to quantify the complexity and self-similarity of irregular shapes. The algorithm reads a 1024x1024 PNG image and returns its Fractal Dimension.

| Fractal Name          | Theoretical fractal dimension  |  Calculated \\ fractal dimension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sierpinski  Triangle  | 1.585  | 1.582  |  
| Koch Curve            |  1.262 | 1.263  |  
| Koch Snowflake        |  1.262 | 1.572  |
